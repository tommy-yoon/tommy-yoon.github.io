                There were two choices at the workplace. One was automation of a tedious workflow so that less work
                would be needed in the future. Another choice was leaving it as it was so that it can secure my job as
                my co-worker told me.
                But I chose to automate it as I couldn't my thought how to improve it. So, I did it. It wasn't the
                reason I quit the job so I actually don't know the consequence but even though losing job was the
                consequence, I would have done the same because my job is make our work automated as a programmer.

            <p class="details">My personality from the Myers Briggs (16 personalities) test is ISTP-T(
                https://www.16personalities.com/istp-personality).

                I am a natural problem-solver.
                I find a problem and think why it happened by analysing symptoms of the problem.
                Then guess paths to get to a solution and simulate in head.
                Lastly, plan the actions to take and do it.

            <p class="details">
                As it is well described in the website about the ISTP-T type personality, I am a born problem-solver. I
                am curious, like practical ways and love hands-on experiences.

                I get easily interested in a new topic but get bored easily as well. So, I speed up sometimes but, like
                now, sometime behind schedule.
                It is hard to keep focusing on the same topic as I can get bored quickly and hard to keep working at the
                same pace all the way.
                However, even though ups and downs, my productivity seems quite good in a long run as when I run I run
                fast as well.
                I just need more risk and schedule management as it is a bit stressful when I am behind.

                So, in my study time, I need to promise myself that I will study everyday equal time rather than being
                behind and then hurry to catch up.

            <p class="details">

                Any topic makes me interested, I become enthusiastic and diligent. So, I need to make myself curious
                about the current study so that I will be eager to spend more energy and time to focus on what I am
                studying now.

                Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but
                there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were,
                and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.

                I have been that much people person so when there is a tenson at workplace, I always didn't know what to
                do and still have no idea. Now I guess there is no actual solution. I think what I should do is just
                letting it be. There are many things I cannot change. There are different types of people and almost
                always conflictions. May be, having tensions is natural events. Who knows?
