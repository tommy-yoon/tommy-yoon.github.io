            <p class="topic">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the
                core learning?</p>
            <p class="details">
            <ul>
                <li>In the tech part are I didn't know JS correctly and still don't CSS much.</li>
                <li>In the core part, growth mindset and neuroplasticity are fascinating. I am a bit old so they give me
                    hope and motivated me.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="topic">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</p>
            <p class="details">I think eventually, they help us focus on current events(what we are doing now) and
                prevent our mind wander around meaninglessly.</p>
            <p class="topic">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
            <p class="details">Growth mindset and neuroplasticity were good surprises.</p>
            <p class="topic">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
            <p class="details">
            <ul>
                <li>The most difficult part was I tend to go through the core parts as it is less interesting so it was
                    easy to lose focus.</li>
                <li>Comparing to tech part, to be honest, it is boring.</li>
                <li>It is irony as the core part is supposed to learn how to control our mind but it was hard to focus
                    on that learning.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="topic">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                learning in a web development bootcamp course?</p>
            <p class="details">I don't know exactly but I guess, attitude is very important. Sometimes more important
                than skillset.</p>
            <p class="topic">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
                have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>
            <p class="details">Not a waste of time but I was not that kin to that actually. It is irony as I know it is
                good and beneficial to me but……still boring to me.</p>
