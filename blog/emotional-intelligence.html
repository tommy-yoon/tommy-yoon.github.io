      <p class="topic">So, Which is more important than others?</p>
      <p class="details">Life success is a result of many factors. Both IQ and EQ play roles in overall success, as well
        as health, wellness, and happiness. Rather than focusing on which factors have a more dominant influence, the
        greatest benefit may lie in learning to improve skills in multiple areas. In addition to strengthening cognitive
        abilities, such as memory and mental focus, you can also acquire and improve social and emotional skills.</p>
      <p class="topic">My thoughts?</p>
      <p class="details">Still, it is a bit hard to grasp the meaning of EQ as I have had IQ tests but not EQ tests. But
        I can figure it out that reading and feeling people's emotion is important. It is important not just for
        employment but for my life outside workplace and we live in many kinds of relation with others. I think
        improving EQ can be a life changer.</p>
