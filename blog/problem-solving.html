      <p class="details">
        The Built-in Methods part was the most challenging to me. I got stuck again and again at almost every step.
        So, I used the below problem solving methods.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reading error messages: this is the most important and the first thing to do analyse the problem. in many cases, 
          problem can be quickly solved by just seeing a line of error message.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pseudocode: either writing a quick note about the logic of 
          the function required or just imagning it in my head.
        </li>
        <li>
          Console.logging: if error messages doesn't show the details problem, 
          I should add console loggings to find out the exactly right place causing the issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Googling: because there are many things I don't know about JavaScript such as syntax, 
          functions and typical patterns of problem solving, Googling is unavoidable to get information.
          Through Googling, I visited MDN and StackOverflow sites a lot. Sometimes, I felt a bit guilty 
          as I could find the exact solution on StackOverflow and could solve my problem by just copy the codes from there.

      </ul>
