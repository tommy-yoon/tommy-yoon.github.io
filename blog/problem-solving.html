      <p class="details">
        The Built-in Methods part was the most challenging to me. I got stuck again and again at almost every step.
        So, I used the below problem solving methods.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reading error messages: this is the most important and the first thing to do analyse the problem. in many cases, 
          problem can be quickly solved by just seeing a line of error message.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pseudocode: either writing a quick note about the logic of 
          the function required or just imagning it in my head.
        </li>
        <li>
          Console.logging: if error messages doesn't show the details problem, 
          I should add console loggings to find out the exactly right place causing the issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Googling: because there are many things I don't know about JavaScript such as syntax, 
          functions and typical patterns of problem solving, Googling is unavoidable to get information.
          Through Googling, I visited <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach">MDN</a> 
          and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12482961/change-values-in-array-when-doing-foreach/12482991">StackOverflow site</a> a lot. Sometimes, I felt a bit guilty 
          as I could find the exact solution on StackOverflow and could solve my problem by just copy the codes from there.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="details"></p>
        For instance, I couldn't understand the different usages of the built-in methods of arrays. 
        I just googled and found a good explanation from a Stack Overflow user, Pointy as below.
        Now I have a good understanding about it. As long as I live as a developer, probably, I will keep visiting the site to get help.
