              <p class="topic">Obstacles found!</p>
<p class="details">
  
  As it is online, I have to manage everything myself.
  Nobody tells me what to do and when to do that.
  So, I easily get lazy.
</p>

<p class="topic">Solution?</p>
	<p class="details">
    1. I need to have a time table  which tells when to focus on the study.
    So, I will have two focus times.
    In the morning from 10AM to 1PM for 3 hours.
    Another one is 3PM to 6PM for 3 hours.
    During focus times, I won't be distracted by anything including my mobile phones, meaningless web surfing and etc.
  </p>
<p class="details">
  
    2. No more catching up but do everything on time and try to do study extended materials to expand my experience as well.
</p>
<p class="topic">
  
  And these are my general plan.
</p>
<p class="details">
  
  <ul>
    <li>Ultimate goal - being familiar web development skills and have tons of practice with them.</li>
    <li>Learning path - As I have some experience as back-end programming, I'b probably better to focus on JavaScript parts so I will be more specialized in dynamic parts of web development field.</li>
    <li>Strength and limitations - Lack of self control is my issue but once I get interested in a topic, I cat focus on that topic and study hard.</li>
    <li>Non-tech skill - I need to get used to New Zealand cluture and improve my English skill</li>
    <li>Commitment - I will follow the above focus times(morning and afternoon) then it will be okay</li>
  </ul>
