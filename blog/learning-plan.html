      <p class="topic">Obstacles found!</p>
      <p class="details">

        As it is online, I have to manage everything myself.
        Nobody tells me what to do and when to do that.
        So, I easily get lazy.
      </p>

      <p class="topic">Solution?</p>
      <p class="details">
        1. I need to have a time table which tells when to focus on the study.
        So, I will have two focus times.
        In the morning from 10AM to 1PM for 3 hours.
        Another one is 3PM to 6PM for 3 hours.
        During focus times, I won't be distracted by anything including my mobile phones, meaningless web surfing and
        etc.
      </p>
      <p class="details">

        2. No more catching up but do everything on time and try to do study extended materials to expand my experience
        as well.
      </p>
      <p class="topic">

        And these are my general plan.
      </p>
      <p class="details">

      <ul>
        <li>Ultimate goal - being familiar web development skills and have tons of practice with them.</li>
        <li>Learning path - As I have some experience as back-end programming, I'b probably better to focus on
          JavaScript parts so I will be more specialized in dynamic parts of web development field.</li>
        <li>Strength and limitations - Lack of self control is my issue but once I get interested in a topic, I cat
          focus on that topic and study hard.</li>
        <li>Non-tech skill - I need to get used to New Zealand cluture and improve my English skill</li>
        <li>Commitment - I will follow the above focus times(morning and afternoon) then it will be okay</li>
      </ul>
