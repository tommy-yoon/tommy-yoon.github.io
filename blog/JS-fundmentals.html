      <p class="topic">An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</p>
        <p class="details">What you see on the web browser are called web pages and they are consist of HTML. HTML have strucutre information and content that is text data. Don't worry about the structure part and just remember all the important contents are included in the HTML part. So when you make and web page with all the texts you type in is making a HTML page. Regarding CSS is nothing but just decoration such as font type, colour and so on of the texts.</p>
      <p class="topic">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking
        <p class="details">
          up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</p>
          Control flow is the order of activities we do everyday. We get up and then tidy up our bed but we don't tidy up our bed and then get up. We simply cannot do that. We turn our TV on then watch the TV show on the TV. We cannot watch anything before turning the TV on. Likwise, we need an order of activities to achieve our daily goals even if it is a simple goal. That is control flow. Also, that control flow can include repetitive activities. For an example, brushing teeth is looping of strokes for a certain amount of time. Another type of control flow is branching. We need to decide what to do almost every moment. For an instance, we choose to order an double burger when we are starving but a Junior Whopper when we are not that hungry. In JavaScript we implement it with If statements. Using it, we can choose differnt control flows.

      <p class="topic">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</p>
      <p class="details">DOM is how HTML is structured. It looks like a big tree and each element eventually connected to the root element. That structure enables us to navigate from the root element to any child element we want to access. So that we can manipulate any element on HTML using JavaScript. For an example we can access a first H1 tag in a HTML page using the below statement. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="details" style="font-style: italic;">document.getElementsByTag('h1')</p>
      
      <p class="topic">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</p>
      <p class="details">
        Arrays - using index. e.g. myArray[1]<br>
        Objects - using property name. e.g. myObject.propertyName or myObject["propertyName"]
      </p>
      <p class="topic">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</p>
      <p class="details">
        Function can be regarded a collection of activities which usually is resued. Let's say you have a garden party. It includes many activities such as inviting people, meal preparation, setting up BBQ and so on. We can simply name it with a simple word and anytime we can reuse(throwing a party again) in the future. Without explaining all the details of the garden party we can simply know the details.
